I am finally starting a blog after many months of procrastination, with an urging need to formalize my ideas and share them with the world. This blog will not have no particular content genre associated with it, but will generally focus on programming, philosophy, statistics and machine learning, life and investments. 

I also have decided to use a node blogging framework called Hexo (http://zespia.tw/hexo/) to power this blog. I did this since I wanted to learn node and what better way than incorporate it into my personal life? Moreover, Hexo is extremely easy to setup and there is a collection of themes to choose from. 

I recently bought a domain name (http://vijayr.co) to establish an internet presence, with this blog being a central piece. Apart from my blog, I plan to add more categories like my notable personal projects from github.
